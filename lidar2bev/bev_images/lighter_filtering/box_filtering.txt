The function get_rot_bevbox in bev_vis_utils.py filters every bounding box, which is with one corner outside the image boundaries.
A lighter approach could be from https://github.com/AlejandroBarrera/birdnet2/blob/5ceed811b289796d7d7420a064ecb079c80801ab/tools/convert_kitti_to_coco_rotation.py#L113.
Here only boxes fully outside (all corners) the image boundaries get clipped to stay inside the image boundaries.

Currently in folder train/labels and val/labels are empty .txt files related to the strict filtering. 
I removed these empty labels with related images from the ultralytics specified dataset folders. 
For the training data the slighter filtering method didn't bring more value (objects with more points). 
On the positive side for the validation data it brought 6 more images, that can be validated. 
The objects have more detail and are not directly at the edge of the image.
